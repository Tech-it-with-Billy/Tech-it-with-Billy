🌟 **About Me**
---

<p>
I'm a passionate and focused software engineering learner currently enrolled in the ALX Frontend Development and ProDev Backend Development programs. My journey into software engineering began with a fascination for how much technology has improved day-to-day business operations. 
</p>

<p>
💡 I aim to contribute to impactful <strong>financial software</strong> and <strong>business support systems</strong> that drive efficiency, innovation, and real-world change. I'm particularly inspired by how well-built tech tools can solve problems at scale and empower users and organizations alike.
